[NBA Scraping](nba_scraping.ipynb) contains scraped data for the NBA from ... website. National BasketBall Association is a prestige American League for top and professional basketballers. Obtaining this data
was necessary not just in trying the necessary packages such as BeatifulSoup but for use in training a model that could predict Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the NBA is future seasons. In another application, 
training a model on previous team data can help to better predict the team's performance and standings in the future seasons, this finds a lucrative application in sports analysis and betting markets.

try my best in scraping for infornatiom as much as the current system could allow me. 

X scrapping is super important in today's frenzy of Artificial Intelligence as the platform holds vast amount of information and discussions that can't be equally obtained from any other social media platform.
X APIs fall in the category of platforms which thier apis are not sustainable small and individual persons and businesses due to the pricing of the apis. 

[Walmart Products Scraped]() is a bot system i used to scrape the walmart website of different products and product information. This scraping exercise presented a very complex system developed by walmart
to proof thier sites against bot actions. I was able to get around the system to extract the necessary information and products i needed. Walmart as one of the largest global e-commence platform contains
tons of information and details about wide range of products. The data of these products can be used not just in learning more about the products but in training models around those products.
